Longest Prefix Suffix 

Given a string of characters, find the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a proper suffix.

Example 1:

Input: s = "abab"
Output: 2
Explanation: "ab" is the longest proper 
prefix and suffix. 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: "aaa" is the longest proper 
prefix and suffix

METHOD:
USING KMP STRING MATCHING ALGORITHM
HERE WE USE THE PATTERN ARRAY WHICH WE USE IN THE KMP TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

class Solution{
public:		

		
	int lps(string s)
	{
	    // Your code goes here
	    int n=s.length();
	    int v[n];
	    int i=1;
	    int len=0;
	    v[0]=0;
	    while(i< n)
	    {
	        if(s[i]==s[len])
	        {
	            len++;
	            v[i]=len;
	            i++;
	            
	        }else{
	            
	            if(len!=0)
	            len=v[len-1];
	            else{
	                
	                v[i]=0;
	                i++;
	            }
	            
	            
	        }
	        
	       
	    }

		return v[n-1]; //dont need to find for maximium value in the array
 //here the value stored in dp[i] is the maximum length of a proper prefix that is also a proper suffix of string 0 to i. So we need to find for the whole string that's why we are returning the last value i.e. lps[n - 1] for string 0 to n - 1;

Wrong Answer. !!!Wrong Answer

Possibly your code doesn't work correctly for multiple test-cases (TCs).

The first test case where your code failed:

Input:
gigummcnu

Its Correct output is:
0

And Your Code's output is:
1


EXPLANATION
Yes, it's 0. Pay attention to the question. It asked for the length of the longest "proper" prefix which is also a "proper" suffix. In your input 'gigummcnu', I believe you've taken g and g as common and think the output should be 1. That is incorrect. Since the initial 'g' is a proper prefix but the g in the middle is not a proper suffix.

Suffix starts at the 0-th index and the prefix ends at the last index. For this string, if your code is giving 1 as the output, it is basically consider "g" equal to "u" and that's clearly wrong.
