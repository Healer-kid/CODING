M-Coloring Problem 
Medium Accuracy: 47.46% Submissions: 17684 Points: 4
Given an undirected graph and an integer M. The task is to determine if the graph can be colored with at most M colors such that no two adjacent vertices of the graph are colored with the same color. Here coloring of a graph means the assignment of colors to all vertices. Print 1 if it is possible to colour vertices and 0 otherwise.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 4
M = 3
E = 5
Edges[] = {(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),(3,0),(0,2)}
Output: 1
Explanation: It is possible to colour the
given graph using 3 colours.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 3
M = 2
E = 3
Edges[] = {(0,1),(1,2),(0,2)}
Output: 0
Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function graphColoring() which takes the 2d-array graph[], the number of colours and the number of nodes as inputs and returns true if answer exists otherwise false. 1 is printed if the returned value is true, 0 otherwise. The printing is done by the driver's code.
Note: In the given 2d-array graph[], if there is an edge between vertex X and vertex Y graph[] will contain 1 at graph[X-1][Y-1], else 0. In 2d-array graph[ ], nodes are 0-based indexed, i.e. from 0 to N-1.

Expected Time Complexity: O(MN).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(N).

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 20
1 ≤ E ≤ (N*(N-1))/2
1 ≤ M ≤ N
